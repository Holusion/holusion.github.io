  <h1>A modern Web User Interface for APTLY</h1>
</section>
<div class="container">
  <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>The authors of this application and <a href="https://holusion.com">Holusion</a> are by no means representatives of the <a href="https://www.aptly.info/">Aptly</a> project. This is an independant work using the API provided by Aptly, under conditions authorized by Aptly's <a href="https://github.com/smira/aptly/blob/master/LICENSE">License</a>.</p>

  <h2> Goals </h2>
  <p>This Web Interface aims to provide a useful visualization and administration toolset to interact directly on Aptly's REST interface.</p>
  <p>Any improvements to data representation and/or new Routes additions should be made in Aptly's <a href="https://github.com/smira/aptly">home repository</a></p>
  <p>With this out of the way, here is the projected feature set :</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Repositories and packages listing (OK)</li>
    <li>Per-Repo Package version and details (OK)</li>
    <li>Packages Upload and deletion (OK)</li>
    <li>Package migration (WIP) </li>
    <li>Snapshot creation and management </li>
  </ul>
  <p> The UI is currently usable but with a lot of missing features and some rough edges. Don't expect every error to be handled cleanly ! </p>
  <p>Contributions are welcomed on <a href="https://github.com/sdumetz/aptly-web-ui">Github</a>

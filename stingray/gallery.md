# Nausicaa : Holographic building model

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>
      Stingray has been used to produce photographic-like rendering on Nausicaa's new building, currently under construction. The goal was to involve visitors in the construction process of Nausicaa's extension.
    </p>
    <p>We used a tailor-made <a href="https://sdumetz.github.io/2016/08/15/capacitive-wheel.html">capacitive wheel</a> to provide users with an easy to use rotation controller.
    </p>
    <p>
      As interactive 3D models are becoming more prevalent in the building industry, we believe there is a need to show previews of architectural projects. Stingray can help here by providing 3D interactions while still using the tools infographists know and love

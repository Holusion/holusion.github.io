  <p>Aptly web UI is a web-based frontend for <a href="https://www.aptly.info/">Aptly's</a> REST interface. It provides a simple way to visualize and administrate any number of repositories. It's simple design is based on <a href="https://getmdl.io/">material design lite</a> and try to be as efficient as possible.</p>
  <h3> Features </h3>
  <p>Any improvements to data representation and/or new Routes additions should be made in Aptly's <a href="https://github.com/smira/aptly">home repository</a></p>
  <p>With this out of the way, here is the projected feature set :</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Repositories and packages listing (OK)</li>
    <li>Per-Repo Package version and details (OK)</li>
    <li>Packages Upload and deletion (OK)</li>
    <li>Package migration (WIP) </li>
    <li>Snapshot creation and management </li>
  </ul>
  <p> The UI is currently usable but with a lot of missing features and some rough edges. Don't expect every error to be handled cleanly ! </p>
